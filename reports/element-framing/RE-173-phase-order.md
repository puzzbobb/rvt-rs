# RE-173: the phase order is `AllProjectPhases.m_phaseIds`, and Snowdon's 6 slabs exist in no phase after Legends

**Date:** 2026-10-05
**Issues:** #328; backlog items B38 and B46
**Artefacts:** 29 local projects, Revit 2023 to 2027: RE1 Architecture, Core Interior, Autodesk's `rac`, `rst` and `rme` samples, Snowdon Towers (2025 edition, 7 disciplines), Golden Nugget (2), three Japanese samples, `02_2025.zip` model 12 (#356), and `01_Walls_Phases` and `01_Walls_Phases_Demo`, two Revit 2025 models made for this question, each with Revit's IFC4 Reference View export (default settings). Measured locally.
**Probe:** `examples/probe_re173_phase_order.rs`.
**Status:** positive. The phase order, the export phase (the last) and the rule for created and demolished phases are each checked against a Revit export. The exporter now applies the rule (`src/native_phases.rs`, `tests/phase_filter.rs`).

## 1. The question

#328: Revit's export of Snowdon Towers leaves out 6 slabs (2287679 to 2287714) that name the phase Legends. rvt-rs has no phase order to compare phases with: the ids are not in sequence, and the link records' lists disagree with each other.

## 2. Method

The probe reads every native record (`native_document::extract_graphs`, B46):

- **Order.** The project's `AllProjectPhases` record, `m_phaseIds`. Its schema fields are `m_phaseIds` and `m_arrPhasingOverrides`. A family document's own `AllProjectPhases` (`m_famId` not -1, an empty list) is skipped.
- **Names.** Each `ProjectPhase` record's `m_name` and `m_description`.
- **Elements.** Each record's `m_createdPhaseId` and `m_demolishedPhaseId`.

For the last phase `P` in the order, it gives each phased record a status:

- created after `P`;
- demolished in `P` or before it;
- otherwise, existing in `P`.

## 3. Result

| file | phase order | records not in the last phase |
|---|---|---|
| Snowdon Towers Architectural 2025 | Legends 2287613, Existing 32440, New Construction 118390 | **6**: Floors 2287679, 2287686, 2287693, 2287700, 2287707 and 2287714, each created **and demolished** in Legends |
| Snowdon Towers Facades 2025 | Existing, New Construction | 104: walls, sweeps and family instances created in Existing and demolished in New Construction |
| Golden Nugget Architektur 2025 | Phase 1, Phase 2 | 33 walls created in Phase 1 and demolished in Phase 2 |
| `01_Walls_Phases` | Existing 1, New Construction 4, Phase 3 2920 | 0 |
| `01_Walls_Phases_Demo` | the same | 1: wall 2892, created in New Construction, demolished in Phase 3 |
| the other 23 files with phases | 2 or 3 phases | 0 |

The three 2023 files return neither an order nor any phased record, so the rule does not apply to them.

- **Legends is the first phase, not the last.** That contradicts the reading of #328's 2026-09-23 lead from the link records' lists. Legends' description says why the slabs are never shown: "Phase used for creating legends - elements are created and demolished in this phase". A record created and demolished in one phase exists in no later phase. In New Construction its status is Past (demolished in an earlier phase).
- **The rule finds exactly #328's six ids**, on the same ids in the 2025 edition, and nothing else on Snowdon Architectural (7,303 phased records exist in New Construction).
- On every file with a reference export here (RE1, Core Interior, the `02_2025.zip` models), the rule leaves nothing out, so it cannot remove an element those exports hold.
- **The export phase is the last one.** In `01_Walls_Phases`, wall 2787 is created in Existing, 2789, 2790 and 2892 in New Construction, and 2788 in Phase 3, the last phase. None is demolished. Revit's export, with no phase chosen, holds all five walls. If it had exported New Construction, 2788 would be Future there and left out.
- **An element demolished in the export phase is left out.** `01_Walls_Phases_Demo` is the same model with wall 2892 demolished in Phase 3. Revit's export holds 2787 to 2790 and not 2892, the one wall the rule leaves out.
- Three files list a phase with ElementId 0 (Snowdon Structural, `rst_advanced` 2027, two Japanese samples). Its `ProjectPhase` record is named, so it is a real phase id.

## 4. What this changes

Revit's IFC exporter exports one phase. Elements whose phase status there is New or Existing are exported. Elements that are Past, Demolished, Temporary or Future there are not. With the order known, each status can be computed from an element's two phase ids:

```text
P = the export phase (index in m_phaseIds); c, d = the element's created and demolished phases
exported  ⇔  index(c) ≤ P  and  (d = -1  or  index(d) > P)
```

With `P` the last phase, this leaves out #328's 6 slabs, and only them, on Snowdon Architectural, and wall 2892 on `01_Walls_Phases_Demo`.

The exporter applies it in this change:

- `native_phases::compute_phase_filter` reads the order and every element's two phase ids in one native pass, memoised as `RevitFile::phase_filter`.
- A new `native_document::Options::graph_classes` decodes graphs only for `AllProjectPhases`. Every other record is read through `native_element::decode_base` alone.
- The filter sits beside `DesignOptions::excludes`, in `without_non_primary_options`, the empty curtain panel scan and the volumeless count.
- Diagnostics report what it leaves out as `element_record_not_in_export_phase`.

Cost, on a Raspberry Pi 5: Snowdon Architectural's export takes about 2 s longer (19.0 and 19.6 s without the filter, 21.1 and 21.2 s with it). The class-only native walk alone is 3 s; decoding every graph would be 20 s.

On the local files the export now leaves out:

| file | left out (skipped item) |
|---|---|
| `01_Walls_Phases_Demo` | 1 wall |
| Snowdon Architectural 2025 | **6**: the Floors 2287679 to 2287714 of #328 (6,035 elements without the filter, 6,029 with it) |
| Snowdon Facades 2025 | 104: Wall 42, GenericModel 25, Window 20, WallSweep 11, Roof 6 |
| Golden Nugget Architektur | 30 of its 33 phase-excluded records: Wall 18, Window 6, StairsRun 2, Railing, Roof, Stair and StairsLanding 1 each |
| the other files | 0 |

Snowdon Architectural and Golden Nugget Architektur are read only with the ElemTable layout fix of RE-175: without it their exports are empty. With it, each of #328's six slabs is exported once, and the filter removes exactly those six ids.

## 5. Not done

- **The export phase.** It is the last phase in `m_phaseIds` with Revit's default export settings (`01_Walls_Phases`). An export setting that picks another phase is not read.
- **Snowdon 2024.** The edition #328 measured is not local. The same six ids are removed on the 2025 edition.
