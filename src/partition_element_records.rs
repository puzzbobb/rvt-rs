//! Partition element-record headers: ElementId + BuiltInCategory + bbox.
//!
//! Revit 2024 project partitions frame each *element* record with a
//! fixed 88-byte prologue whose first field is the record's own
//! `ElementId` and whose sixth field is the element's Revit
//! `BuiltInCategory` id (a negative, publicly documented constant).
//! The prologue is followed by the element's model-space bounding
//! box as six `f64` feet values.
//!
//! Layout observed on `2024_Core_Interior.rvt`
//! (sha256 `c805df44…`, Revit 2024, eight `Partitions/*` streams,
//! ~190 MiB inflated):
//!
//! ```text
//! +0x00  u64  ElementId of this record (declared in Global/ElemTable)
//! +0x08  u32  record flags (0x00e1 / 0x0111 / 0x0131 / 0x0141 / … )
//! +0x0c  u32  0x0000059f on every observed record of this shape
//! +0x10  u16  0
//! +0x12  i64  BuiltInCategory id, negative (OST_Columns = -2000100)
//! +0x1a  16B  0xff sentinel padding (two u64 slots, never set here)
//! +0x2a  u64  design option ElementId, 0xff×8 = main model (#319)
//! +0x32  u64  container ElementId, 0xffff_ffff_ffff_ffff = none
//! +0x3a  u64  0xff sentinel (never set on observed records)
//! +0x42  u32  placement kind: 0xffffef7f placed / 0xffff8000 symbol
//! +0x46  u32  flags (m_abFlags4Bytes per Discussion #112; not interpreted)
//! +0x4a  u16  class tag: the element's class as the definition ordinal of
//!             the file's own Formats/Latest (#223, [`crate::formats::schema_classes`])
//! +0x4c  u32  0xffffffff on every observed record of this shape
//! +0x50  8B   bbox marker 46 01 ff ff ff ff ab 05
//! +0x58  48B  bounding box: min x/y/z, max x/y/z, feet, f64 LE
//! +0x88  u32  reference-list length n
//! +0x8c  n*8  n u64 reference slots
//! ```
//!
//! The two fields at `+0x32` and `+0x42` are what separates the
//! records Revit's own exporter emits as building elements from the
//! rest — see [`PartitionElementRecord::is_exported_instance`] and
//! `reports/element-framing/RE-21-partition-element-record-instance-rule.md`.
//!
//! The counted reference list that follows the bounding box is what
//! binds a door or window to its host wall — see
//! [`decode_reference_list`],
//! [`PartitionElementRecord::preceding_reference`] and
//! `reports/element-framing/RE-23-door-window-host-binding.md`.
//!
//! 24880 records of this shape were found on that file; 23470 of
//! them (94.3 %) carry the bbox marker at exactly `+0x50`, which is
//! why the marker offset is treated as fixed rather than searched.
//! Every `ElementId` recovered this way is declared in
//! `Global/ElemTable`, and the scan requires that join — an offset
//! whose leading `u64` is not a declared id is rejected, so a random
//! byte match cannot become an element.
//!
//! # Honesty
//!
//! - The `BuiltInCategory` ids are Autodesk's published API
//!   constants; nothing here is derived from Revit binaries.
//! - Only the fields above are claimed. The sentinel runs, the flags
//!   word, `0x059f`, `+0x46` and `+0x4a` are recorded, not interpreted.
//! - `+0x32` is named `container` because every non-sentinel value
//!   observed is an ElementId declared in `Global/ElemTable`, is
//!   lower than every member id that names it, owns a contiguous
//!   ElementId block spanning several categories at once, and has no
//!   element record of its own. What kind of container Revit calls it
//!   is not claimed.
//! - `+0x42` is named `placement_kind` because it takes exactly two
//!   values on the corpus and they partition the records into placed
//!   instances and type/symbol envelopes. The numbers are recorded,
//!   not decoded.
//! - The `+0x88` list is named a *reference list* because its slots
//!   hold ElementIds and because the slot before the record's own id
//!   is, on every door and window record of the recorded edge, the
//!   host wall Revit's own exporter voids. What the other slots mean
//!   is recorded, not claimed: the leading slot is `3` on every
//!   observed record, and the remaining slots are family / type /
//!   level ids in ascending order. The list length is `u32`-counted,
//!   not sentinel-terminated, and the count is bounded by
//!   [`REFERENCE_LIST_MAX_ENTRIES`] so a garbage word cannot make the
//!   decoder walk off.
//! - One more slot of that list is read, and only for placed
//!   instances: [`PartitionElementRecord::type_symbol_reference`],
//!   the last slot before the record's own id that is itself a
//!   `PLACEMENT_KIND_SYMBOL` record of the same `BuiltInCategory`.
//!   On the recorded edge that is `5755` on all 256 exported
//!   `OST_Columns` instances, which is the `IfcColumnType.Tag` Revit's
//!   own export writes for every one of them (#215, RE-26). What the
//!   remaining slots mean is still recorded, not claimed.
//! - A *second* counted list follows the first, framed identically.
//!   Its last slot is named [`PartitionElementRecord::owner_reference`]
//!   because on every [`OST_SKETCH_LINES`] record of the recorded edge
//!   it names the element whose sketch the line belongs to: the 3106
//!   sketch-line records on `2024_Core_Interior.rvt` name 135 owners,
//!   and 100 of them are exactly the 80 `IfcSlab` + 20
//!   `IfcShadingDevice` ElementIds the reference export tags (#31,
//!   RE-25). On other categories it is only what the byte says.
//! - Category membership alone is **not** an instance claim: a
//!   family symbol carries the same category as its instances.
